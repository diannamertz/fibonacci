Fibonacci Sequence for iPad using C4 Framework

This project sketch visualizes the relationship between the Fibonacci Numbers and the Fibonacci Spirals in a pine cone. The seeds of a pine cone form two sets of Fibonacci Spirals in opposite directions that originate in the base of a pine cone. In a normal pine cone, the number of spirals in either direction count up to a Fibonacci Number: 8 and 13. 

Here is a sceencast of the project in the simulator:
