Fibonacci Sequence for iPad using C4 Framework

This project sketch visualizes the relationship between the Fibonacci numbers and the Fibonacci spirals in a pine cone. The seeds of a pine cone form two sets of Fibonacci spirals in opposite directions that originate in the base of a pine cone. The number of spirals in each direction count up to a Fibonacci number: 8 and 13. 

Here is a sceencast of the project in the simulator:
